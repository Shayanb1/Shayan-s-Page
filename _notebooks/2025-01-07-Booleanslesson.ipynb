    "What is booleans? Booleans are a fundamental data type in programming that represent two possible values: true or false. They are commonly used to make decisions in code, control the flow of programs through conditional statements, and evaluate logical expressions. Booleans are essential for comparisons, determining equality, and managing program logic effectively."
