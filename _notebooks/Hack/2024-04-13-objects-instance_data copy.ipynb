    "## Properties and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Properties**: These are the values associated with a JavaScript object. A JavaScript object is a collection of unordered properties. Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Methods**: These are actions that can be performed on objects. A method is a property that contains a function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider an object representing a player in a game:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const player = {\n",
