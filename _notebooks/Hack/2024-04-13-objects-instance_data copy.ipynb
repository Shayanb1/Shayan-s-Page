    "### 1) Combine Concept of Object Literal and Object Instance\n",
    "- The playerData array is defined using object literals to store data about each player (name, health, and powers).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) An Array of Player Object Instances, while giving them Health and Power\n",
    "- The players array holds the Player instances, and each player has a name, health, and powers. These powers are represented as an object containing specific attributes like speed, strength, and defense. For example, Raphael’s speed can be 10, strength is 2, and defense is 8.\n",
    "- I created a gameloop that keeps cycling until only one character is left with more than 0 HP\n",
    "- Each character loses HP (Health Points) per every round, depending on how strong the other characters are\n",
    "- Leader board is displayed after every round with a round counter until a winner has been picked.\n",
    "- Characters have been elimenated once they reach 0 HP."
