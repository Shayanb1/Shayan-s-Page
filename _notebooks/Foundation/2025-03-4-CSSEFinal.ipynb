    "<h2>5 Core Skills I Learned in this class (1st point)</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Well understanding of Booleans and Variables as I taught that in my lesson\n",
    "As I was learning what booleans are, at first I thought that it was just 1+1=2 or something like that, but as I dug deeper into the topic I learned a lot of cool commands in booleans, sometimes it can be just like math. This lesson helped me develope in many ways as I learned about both Booleans and about Variables because they are 2 very similar topics and I really enjoyed that topic.\n",
    "### 2. Installing and verifying tools\n",
    "In the beginning of the class I thought my computer automatically had tools installed and I could just relax because I thoguht everything was going to be easy, but then I saw how other students were doing work that I should have been doing, which was when I learned from my peers how to install tools and then verify them after which made me have a greater understanding of what will come next in the class and what to expect.\n",
    "### 3. Creating files in VS Code and learning how VS Code works\n",
    "VS code used to be insanly confusing to me, at first I didn't even know how to install the app on my computer, but as I progressed through this course, my teachers/ta's tought me everything I know about VS code, like creating files, creating images, blogs, and even my homepage in my blog. In VS code I learned what a terminal is and how to use it, I learned how to find paths of files to create pathways into other files, and I also learned how to create cool projects like my Snake game and RPG game.\n",
    "### 4. Learning how to colobarate with a group in coding\n",
    "Colaborating with a group has been a big struggle for me in lots of classes because I usually don't understand all of the material, and even thoguh in this course I may not have been the best programmmer in every topic, I really appreciated the oppertunity to work with a group to create my own teaching lesson. That experience was really valuable to me because it showed me what it feels like to grade people, teach a lesson, and work with new people.\n",
    "### 5. Learning how to troubleshoot my code, and use feedback from others efficiently\n",
    "One of my favorite parts in this course was troubleshooting, for a long time in this class I didn't even know what troubleshooting meant but as I learned what troubleshooting is and how to do it alone, it slowly became one of my favorite parts about the class, because as I trouble shoot I feel like it is a great sucess when I fix my errors correctly without having to get someone else to fix my code for me. Also, using feedback from others was a great skill that I learned, after I created my game I had lots of feedback from both family and friends, as I listened to all this feedback I realized that if I had asked more questions applying to the feedback earlier, I could have had a really good game, which is how I learned to try to look for as much feedback as I can at all times.\n",

I have effectively utilized GitHub, and collaborated well with my peers, as demonstrated in my projects. Although there is still room for improvement, deepening my understanding of various tools, and progressing through advanced JavaScriptâ€”I am proud of my progress and dedication to learning. Given my accomplishments and areas for growth, I would assign myself a final grade of 0.87/1, recognizing both my achievements and the heavy potential for further development.\n"
