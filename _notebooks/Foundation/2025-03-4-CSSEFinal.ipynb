My ability to effectively use GitHub, develop interactive web pages, and collaborate with peers has been evident in the projects I have completed. While I recognize there are areas for improvement, particularly in backend development, solidifying my tools knowledge, and advanced JavaScript, I am confident in my progress and commitment to learning. Therefore, I would give myself a final grade of 0.93/1, acknowledging both my achievements and the potential for further growth.</p>\n"
